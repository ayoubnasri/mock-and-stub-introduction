## Simple Exercice to train the basics of stubbing and mocking

There are two similar exercices. 

### stubSomeValues

Cover the class BirthdayService, by stubbing the Repository to return true or false 
depending on with what name it is called

### verifySomeBehavior

Again cover BirthdayService. Since the method greeting has no return value we need to verify that
mailer was called with the correct greeting phrase.
